The following Haskell code attempts to calculate the factorial of a number using a recursive function. However, it contains a subtle error that can lead to unexpected results or even stack overflow for larger inputs:

```haskell
factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)
```

The issue lies in the lack of explicit handling for negative input. The recursive call `factorial (n - 1)` will continue indefinitely for negative `n`, resulting in a stack overflow.
