The corrected Haskell code addresses the issue by adding a check for negative input:

```haskell
factorial :: Integer -> Maybe Integer
factorial 0 = Just 1
factorial n | n < 0 = Nothing  -- Handle negative input
             | otherwise = Just (n * fromJust (factorial (n - 1)))

```

This version uses the `Maybe` type to represent the possibility of an error. If the input is negative, it returns `Nothing`. Otherwise, it performs the recursive calculation and returns `Just` the result. The `fromJust` function is used to safely extract the value from the `Maybe` type in the recursive call.  This prevents stack overflow and provides a way to handle invalid inputs gracefully.
